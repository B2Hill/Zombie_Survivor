# Zombie Survivor
https://github.com/B2Hill/Zombie_Survivor/tree/main
## Description:
Zombie Survivor is intended to be a rouge lite, horde survival game. The game design is applicable to the digital arts field by testing creativity and application of key coding skills to create the final output. The game is a twist on the horde survival/Vampire Survivors Genre with the player character being a Monster/Zombie with abilities inspired by Zombie media and enemy mechanics from other games from the genre.

## Features/Mechanics:
- Enemy tracking
- Player Character and Enemy health
- Directional movement
- Random Enemy spawn locations
- Random Item drops
- Experience/Level- up System
- Player Power- ups
- Difficulty scaling
- Progressive bonuses
- Seamless stage looping
- Tracking survival time

## Challenges:
The major challenges will be creating the mechanics to endlessly loop the play area, the directional movement that keeps the visible area centered on the Player Character, and balancing the game so that it is difficult but also provides the power fantasy that the genre gives to the player.

## Outcomes:
### Ideal:
 The ideal outcome for the project is for the game to have at least 8 different character abilities, 8 different player power- ups, minimum of 10 enemy types, at least 1 playable map, functioning player progression system, a menu system to allow player the player to quickly restart or exit the game, and simple retro graphics(art) for all assets.

### Minimal:
Player movement system fully functioning, 1 playable map that loops, 4 different character abilities, 4 player power- ups, 5 enemy types, enemy tracking, random item/power- ups drops and enemy spawning locations, tracking survival time, a win/failure state and minimalistic graphics(art) for all assets.
